<p>
    👦🏻 Hi, I'm Marcin and I'm always learning, and unlearning. Primarily about software engineering, psychological safety, diversity &
    inclusion, leadership, complexity and organisational design. My <a href="https://pronoun.is/he" target="_blank">pronoun.is/he</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <i>"A ship in a harbour is safe, but that is not what ships are built for."</i> - this quote attributed to John A. Shedd, and later also used by Grace Hopper, characterises well my approach to life. I step into my days with alacrity.
</p>
<p>
    👨‍💻 Since 2015 I worked at <i class="fa-brands fa-spotify"></i> Spotify in Stockholm. As a Director of Engineering since 2017 I supported engineering teams building Spotify core
    playback technologies. Since mid-2021 I worked as Technology Operations Lead across a 1000+ organisation we call the Experience Mission, using data and insights to understand and improve organisational performance.<br>
    Since Jan 2023 I worked as a Director of Technology and Product supporting teams building content delivery and playback technologies.
</p>
<p>
    Now it is time for new adventures. <i>Stay tuned.</i>
</p>

<h2>Public Speaking</h2>
<article>
I really enjoy public speaking and have gotten a lot of positive feedback for my presentations. Over the years I have covered a lot of topics that tended to be related to personal growth, engineering practices, management and leadership. One of my favourite subjects for a while was explaining to folks that <mark><i>"There is no Spotify model"</i></mark>.

These days I tend focus, broadly speaking, on:
<ul>
    <li>Psychological Safety</li>
    <li>Complexity</li>
    <li>Leadership</li>
    <li>Culture</li>
    <li>Organisational Design</li>
    <li>Distributed Work</li>
</ul>

I gladly present talks at universities, internal company events and conferences. Please reach out if you think I could join your event.
