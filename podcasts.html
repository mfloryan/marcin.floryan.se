My audio listening is mostly podcast listening. Here is a small sample of my "podcast hits": past episodes I enjoyed.

<ul>
    {% for item in site.data.podcasts %}
    <li> {{ item.show }} &mdash; <a href="{{ item.url }}">{{ item.name }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>

You can find all of these (and possibly some new additions) on my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/67KaWBZICUBshbQgGVl8Jt" target="_blank">Spotify playlist</a>.
